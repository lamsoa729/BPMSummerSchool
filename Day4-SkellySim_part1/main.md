## What is SkellySim?
### ...and why the weird name?

* Cytoskeleton (skelly) simulator (sim)
  * Doesn't hurt that it is very similar to Shelley
* Full hydrodynamic simulation of
  * Fibers: Microtubules or other flexible filaments
  * Bodies: Smooth 'rigid' objects like organelles or MTOCs
  * Periphery: Smooth/convex containing volume (cell boundary)


## Why is SkellySim?
### Some motivation

### Microtubule-induced cytoplasmic streaming in oocytes

## Why is SkellySim? (2)
### Can't aLENS do those things?

* In some ways, yes. In others, no.
  * Full hydro
  * More rigorous flexible filaments
  * No fiber-fiber interaction
  * Doesn't scale to millions of elements


## Why is SkellySim? (3)
### A history

* Ground-up re-write of work in BPM by **Gokberk Kabacaoglu** (now at Bilkent University, Ankara)
  * Which itself was an extension of work by **Florencio Balboa Usabiaga** (now at Basque Center for Applied Math)
  * Original python code had limited extendability and scalability
  * Solver stalled in large and unavoidable external "serial" code portions
  * Re-write started in October 2020
  * Currently ~50x faster than original implementation (iirc)


## Focus of re-write (with self-grade)

* Extensible: **B-**
  * Components should allow for different implementations
  * Easy to add new functionality without breaking other components
* Fast/scalable: **A+**
  * Code should strive to scale linearly with elements and cores
* Readability: **C+**
  * Code should be readable with an intermediate knowledge of `C++`
* Documented: **B**
  * Should have usable developer and user documentation
* Usable: **A-**


## SkellySim technology overview

* Medium-sized `C++/python` code leveraging:
  * `MPI` to distribute calculation for simulation objects
  * `Trilinos` for `GMRES` solver to resolve "global" matrix equations
  * `Eigen` for "local" matrix/vector computations
  * `PVFMM/STKMM` for hydrodynamic calculations
    * `CUDA` and `CPU` direct solvers for smaller systems
  * `msgpack` for serialization/inter-language communication
  * `blender` for visualization
* ~6800 lines of `C++`
* ~4200 lines of `python`

# Tutorial: Running SkellySim for the first time
### Robert Blackwell
#### https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/~rblackwell/skelly_sim
Note: If it doesn't work, with the text
```bash
Found built image, launching...
Launching server...
User <youremail> already has a running server.
```
click the 'Flatiron Institute' logo at the top of the page and then
click 'Check your currently running server' on the righthand side of the page. 
This should bring you to the jupyter notebook.



# Visualizing with Blender
