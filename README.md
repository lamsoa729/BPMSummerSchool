# BPM Summer School
Collection of resources for the Biophysical Modeling Software Summer School

## Goal
**Quickly acquaint new personel with compuational tools developed at Flatiron to model biophysical phenomena.**
    1. Understand the strengths and limitations of methods when applied to scientific problems.
    2. Learn how to debug, troubleshoot, and analyze data from simulations.
    3. Be comfortable submitting large jobs to the Flatiron cluster.
