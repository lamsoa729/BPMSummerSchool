# Tutorial: Pre-workshop software installation and cluster setup 

### Instructors: Adam and Reza


## Git and github
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people.
To install git, follow the instructions at [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Mac
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- Linux
  ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```
- Windows
   Download installer https://git-scm.com/download/win or if using WSL, follow Linux instructions


## Github
The following will make the rest of your installations easier since you will be able to just clone this repositories from github and click on the links to download the software.
1. Set up a github account if you don't already have one.
2. Visit the following repositories 'https://github.com/lamsoa729/BPMSummerSchool`
3. (Optional) You can clone this onto your own computer by running the following command in your terminal
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lamsoa729/BPMSummerSchool.git
   ``` 


## Conda
Conda is a package manager that allows you to install and manage multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies. It also allows you to create isolated environments for different projects.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
# If Linux
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
# If Mac
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
```


# Pre-software installation (_aLENS_)

## Docker 
Dockers are containers that allow you to run software in an isolated environment. This is useful for testing and playing around with software without having to install it on your computer. It is also useful for sharing software with others.
- Sign up at docker hub [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Download docker desktop [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- (Optional) Docker engine
   - Linux [https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/how-install-and-use-docker-linux/](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/how-install-and-use-docker-linux/)
   - Mac [https://medium.com/crowdbotics/a-complete-one-by-one-guide-to-install-docker-on-your-mac-os-using-homebrew-e818eb4cfc3](https://medium.com/crowdbotics/a-complete-one-by-one-guide-to-install-docker-on-your-mac-os-using-homebrew-e818eb4cfc3)


## Paraview 
Paraview is a visualization tool that allows you to view and interact with 3D data generated by simulations.
* Download paraview [https://www.paraview.org/download/](https://www.paraview.org/download/)
* Follow instructions


## HDF5view
HDF5view is a tool that enables you to view and interact with the otherwise bindary HDF5 files.
- Sign up for service [https://www.hdfgroup.org/register/](https://www.hdfgroup.org/register/)
- Download at [https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/#download](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/#download)


## VSCode installation (optional)

- Windows
   - See next slide
- Mac
  - Install xcode: open a terminal and run `xcode-select --install`
  - Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac
- Linux
   - Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux


## Windows Instructions
- Follow the three steps at this link to install WSL, VS Code, and the WSL extension for VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl#_installation
- Check if your installation worked: follow these instructions to open VS Code and connect to WSL: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl#_open-a-remote-folder-or-workspace
- If you see "WSL" in the bottom left of your VS Code window, your installation is working


## Cluster setup
See the Flatirons wiki https://docs.simonsfoundation.org/index.php/RemoteConnect to follow along with the instructions for setting up your cluster account.
