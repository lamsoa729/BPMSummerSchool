- Mac
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- Linux

2. Visit the following repositories 'https://github.com/lamsoa729/BPMSummerSchool`
3. (Optional) You can clone this onto your own computer by running the following command in your terminal
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lamsoa729/BPMSummerSchool.git
   ``` 


## Conda
Conda is a package manager that allows you to install and manage multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies. It also allows you to create isolated environments for different projects.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
# If Linux
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
# If Mac
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh

bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
```


# Pre-software installation (_aLENS_)

## Docker 
Dockers are containers that allow you to run software in an isolated environment. This is useful for testing and playing around with software without having to install it on your computer. It is also useful for sharing software with others.
- Sign up at docker hub [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Download docker desktop [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
